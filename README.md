This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Firebase configuration values. You can use `.env.example` as a template:

```bash
# Copy the example file
 cp .env.example .env.local
 
# Then edit .env.local with your actual Firebase credentials
```

**Important Security Notes:**
- Never commit `.env.local` or any other environment files containing secrets to version control
- All environment variables are properly ignored in `.gitignore`
- For production deployment, set environment variables in your hosting platform (e.g., Vercel)
- The `.env.example` file contains placeholders and is safe to commit
- Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration data

## Security Best Practices

This project follows security best practices to protect sensitive information:

1. **Environment Variables**: All sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables, never hardcoded
2. **Git Ignore**: Sensitive files like `.env.local` are excluded from version control
3. **Public vs Private Variables**: 
   - Public variables (prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) are available to the client-side code
   - Private variables (without the prefix) are only available server-side
4. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review code for accidentally committed secrets

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

**Important for Deployment**:
- Set your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard, not in committed files
- Never expose Firebase private keys or other secrets in client-side code
